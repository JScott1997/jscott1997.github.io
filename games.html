                <p class="section_text2_styling">
                    Forage Friendzy is a game created from scratch in the Unity game engine by a team called B.A.T.S. that I was a programmer for in our capstone project with Brock University.
                    We got to showcase Forage Friendzy at Level Up and GD Launch!

                    My main personal goal within this project was to add something new to my skillset as a game programmer.
                    The challenge of working on my first networked game accomplished this as I had no prior experience with this before this project.
                    I was also able to expand and improve upon my skills and experiences I gained from my previous years project Puzzlegeist.
                    This was the most demanding (in a good way) project I have been a part of and I am proud of what the team and I were able to accomplish.

                    Puzzlegeist is another game that was created from scratch by our team Sigma Studios as our 3rd year capstone project with Niagara College.
                    Puzzlegeist was also created in the Unity game engine and was showcased virtually at GD Showcase 2022.

                    Puzzlegeist was my first experience being a part of a game studio structured team.
                    A lot of my time spent working on this project was new and exciting experiences that had a great impact on my development as a game programmer.
                    Finally gaining experience working on a team with other programmers was crucial in my development of writing concise and logical code.
                    Puzzlegeist gave me my first glimpse of how fun game development is when you are a part of a team that has a passion and vision for what they are creating.
                    We did not do as much marketing for Puzzlegeist as my team for Forage Friendzy did but I have set up a google drive if you would like to try out the game!

                <p class="section_text2_styling">
                    The Wild Return is a smaller game that was created in a Rapid Game Development Course I took at Niagara College in my 2nd year.
                    4 other students and I named our team Dead Pixel and we were tasked to create a small game from a given starting point.
                    We were provided with a bare bones Unity project that contained basic 3D side scroller functionality.
                    From this we were given creative freedom to form a vision of what we wanted to mold the project into, and execute on that vision by creating our own art assets and manipulating/adding code to create desired mechanics.
                    I believe our team went above and beyond with our western shooter take on this side scroller task.
                </p>
                <p class="section_text2_styling">
                    With only 2 programmers on the team I did a lot of mechanic implementation and UI programming, as well as debugging and QA.
                    While all credit goes to my programming partner for his fantastic job making a super fun boss battle at the end of the game.
                    The game is challenging but if you want to take on Mad Dog McCoy yourself feel free to try it out with the link below.
