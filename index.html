                    <br>Oh, say can you see by the dawn’s early light
                    What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming?
                    Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight,
                    O’er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
                    And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
                    Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
                    Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
                    O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

                <p class="section_text2_styling">
                    Forage Friendzy is a game created from scratch by our team called B.A.T.S. and was our capstone project with Brock University for our final year of schooling.
                    We got to showcase Forage Friendzy at Level Up and GD Launch!

                    My main personal goal within this project was to add something new to my skillset as a game programmer.
                    The challenge of working on my first networked game accomplished this goal as that was a skillset I did not possess prior to this project.
                    I was also able to expand and improve upon my skills and experiences I gained from my previous years project Puzzlegeist.
                    This was the most demanding (in a good way) project I have been a part of and I am proud of what the team and I were able to accomplish.

                    Puzzlegeist was my first experience being a part of a game studio structured team.
                    A lot of my time spent working on this project was new and exciting experiences that had a great impact on my development as a game programmer.
                    Finally gaining experience working on a team with other programmers was crucial in my development of writing concise and logical code.
                    Puzzlegeist gave me my first glimpse of how fun game development is when you are a part of a team that has a passion and vision for what they are creating.
                    We did not do as much marketing for Puzzlegeist as my team for Forage Friendzy did but I have set up a google drive if you would like to try out the game!

                <p class="section_text2_styling">
                    The Wild Return is a game that was created for a one semester Rapid Game Development Course I took at Niagara College in my 2nd year.
                    4 other students and I named our team Dead Pixel and we were tasked to create a small game from a given starting point.
                    We were provided with a Unity project that contained bare bones 3D side scroller functionality.
                    From this we were expected to create our own environment and art assets along with mechanics that made sense for our game.
                    I believe our team went above and beyond with our western shooter take on this side scroller task.
                </p>
                <p class="section_text2_styling">
                    With only 2 programmers on the team I did a lot of mechanic implementation and UI programming, as well as debugging and QA.
                    While all credit goes to my programming partner for his fantastic job making a super fun boss battle at the end of the game.
                    The game is challenging but if you want to take on Mad Dog McCoy yourself feel free to try it out with the link below.
