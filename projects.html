        <p class="section_text2_styling">
            Glorb Mayhem is a small individually developed game project that I created with a focus on implementing relevant game programming techniques to practical applications.
            These techniques include using an object pool to handle bullet insantiation, a finite state machine to handle the enemies behaviour, implementaion of a persistent scene, and more.
            It also gave me an opportunity to play around with developing throttle and steering mechanics for vehicles which I had fun doing.
            I apologize for the programmer art and borrowed asset for the enemies but making the project look pretty was not the purpose of it.

            I'm not just a nerdy programmer, I can create some art too.
            The following projects were made in 3DS Max during the early years of my schooling.
            I had a lot of fun creating them and put a lot of time and effort in to making the 3D models and animations high quality.
            I may not be a 3DS Max expert but I am proud of how these projects turned out.
